      <p> Hi My name my project is compiled of a series of images which when played create a funny animation as well as includes sound effects. I used a series of if loops

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Boxing Fight </h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of images, loops, and audio . my project is compiled of a series of images which when played create a funny animation as well as includes sound effects. I used a series of if loops 
  as well as created my own methods one for images and the other for sound. When running the sketch the images apear in order with a time frame in between. The colourful animation shows two fighters having a boxing match.
